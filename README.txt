Independent Programming 2 Practice - Functions

Good code is organized into functions.   This assignment allows you to demonstrate organizing your code into functions (including a main() function).

Write a program (with comments) that take an order of 3 different burgers at a burger shop and ask if user wants them with sides. You should have a helper function that prints a welcome message and the menu. You should have another helper function for each item that a user can order that takes in the quantity of that item as an argument and returns the total cost (to at most 2 decimal places).  You should have another helper function for sides that will take total number of burgers and return the price for the sides. The helper functions should not print nor request user input. You should have a main() function that asks the user how many of each item and calculates the total cost of the order. The main() should print the user’s order as well as the total cost of the order at most 2 decimal places.


Any program that does not run cannot receive more than
•	All code contained in the specified functions (no global code)
•	Helper functions							
•	Main function								
•	Calculations correct							
•	Input and output clear to user					
•	Comments								
Note: Independent Programming assignments collectively count for 40% of your overall grade.
